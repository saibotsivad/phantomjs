**Note** There is no need to ask when a binary package for a given platform will be ready. The packagers are fully aware of every release and they give their best effort to make the binaries available.

## Windows

Download [phantomjs-2.1.1-windows.zip](https://bitbucket.org/ariya/phantomjs/downloads/phantomjs-2.1.1-windows.zip) (17.4 MB) and extract (unzip) the content.

The executable `phantomjs.exe` is ready to use.

**Note**: For this static build, the binary is self-contained with no external dependency. It will run on a fresh install of Windows Vista or later versions. There is no requirement to install Qt, WebKit, or any other libraries.

## Mac OS X

Download [phantomjs-2.1.1-macosx.zip](https://bitbucket.org/ariya/phantomjs/downloads/phantomjs-2.1.1-macosx.zip) (16.4 MB) and extract (unzip) the content.
